This model is a mathematical model that allows to simulate the spread of TBS and TBMR in DR Congo.

To run these source codes, download GAMAPLATFORM 1.8 url: https://gama-platform.github.io/download for free. Please be sure that you have JDK or JRE installed in your system. Create a new model and copy/paste the model to your GAMA, file: ebm.gaml. 

Run R files to have friendly plots.
